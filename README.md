### **"Tag Puzzle Game"**
This project implements a visually appealing, interactive, and responsive sliding puzzle game often referred to as the "Tag Puzzle" or "15 Puzzle". The project was developed collaboratively by me and @JagerDGrowly and demonstrates our skills in web development, programming logic, and effective collaboration.
### **Key Features:**
1. **Dynamic Gameplay Logic**:
    - Core game mechanics like identifying and swapping neighboring tiles are implemented using vanilla JavaScript without relying on external libraries.
    - The logic ensures proper grid handling, neighbor detection, and tile rearrangement functionality.
    - Integrated a winning condition check with real-time feedback when the puzzle is solved.

2. **Responsive & Interactive UI**:
    - The interface is styled with CSS, showcasing concepts like custom CSS variables, animations, and transitions.
    - Includes a "Play Again" button to facilitate instant replay without page refresh, using event-driven interactions.

3. **Animations & Visual Feedback**:
    - Background animations ensure a visually engaging experience.
    - Tiles respond to user interactions with hover effects, smooth transitions, and grid position changes.

4. **Modern JavaScript Features**:
    - Utilizes ES6+ syntax such as `const/let`, arrow functions, `Array` manipulation methods (`map`, `sort`).
    - Illustrates optimal use of modular and reusable helper functions to maintain clean and maintainable code.

### **Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
#### **Frontend Development**:
- **HTML**: Structured and semantic layout using sections and tags.
- **CSS**: Responsive design with principles including:
    - CSS Grid for dynamic grid generation.
    - CSS animations (`@keyframes`) and transitions for engaging visuals.
    - Theme variables to support a light/dark flexibility.

- **JavaScript**: Game implementation using:
    - Event handling (e.g., `addEventListener` for user interactions like clicks).
    - DOM manipulation to dynamically create and update grid tiles.
    - Condition-based animations and class modifications.

#### **Problem-Solving**:
- Developed a robust algorithm for neighbor detection using mathematical calculations on grid positions.
- Implemented winning condition checks by verifying the sequential order of game tiles.

#### **Collaboration**:
- Successfully worked as a duo, leveraging task breakdown, code review, and effective communication to meet project goals.
- Followed clean, modular code principles to enhance teamwork and ensure code clarity.

### **Ideal Use Cases:**
This project is ideal to showcase:
- Proficiency in modern web development practices (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Ability to create interactive UIs with responsive styling and animations.
- Collaboration and problem-solving skills in handling practical scenarios.
